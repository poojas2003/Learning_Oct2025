<p>The CSS position property controls the placement of elements on a web page, allowing you to override the normal document flow. It works in conjunction with the top, bottom, left, and right properties to specify the final location. 
The position property accepts five main values: 
static: This is the default value for all HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the page, and the offset properties (top, bottom, etc.) have no effect.
relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. Setting top, bottom, left, or right values shifts the element from its original place, but other elements on the page behave as if the element is still in its original location, leaving a gap. It is also often used as a containing block for absolutely positioned child elements.
absolute: The element is removed entirely from the normal document flow and does not create a gap in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (any ancestor element with a position value other than static). If no positioned ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> element (the initial containing block) and moves with page scrolling.
fixed: The element is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled, making it ideal for elements like fixed headers or footers.
sticky: This value toggles between relative and fixed positioning based on the user's scroll position. The element acts as a relative element until it reaches a specified scroll threshold (e.g., top: 0), at which point it "sticks" in the viewport like a fixed element until its containing block scrolls out of view. You must specify at least one offset property (top, right, bottom, or left) for it to work. </p>
